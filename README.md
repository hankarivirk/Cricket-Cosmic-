## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Get Credentials

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `API_ID` / `API_HASH` | [my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps) |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) → `/newbot` |
| `ADMIN_ID` | [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → your Telegram ID |
| `MONGO_URI` | [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) → free cluster connection string |

All five of these are **required** — the bot now checks for them on startup and
exits with a clear error message if any are missing, instead of silently
crash-looping with no log explanation.

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
API_ID=12345678
API_HASH=abcd1234efgh5678
BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF...
ADMIN_ID=987654321
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/
PLAYZONE_LINK=https://t.me/your_playzone_group
SUPPORT_LINK=https://t.me/your_support_group
```

> 💡 GIF links are already wired in `config.py` from the `@assetshaibkl` channel.
> Bot username is auto-detected — no need to set it manually.

### 3. Install & Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## 🚂 Deploy on Railway

1. Push this code to a **GitHub repo**.
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Select your repo.
4. Go to **Variables** tab → add all the ENV variables from `.env.example`.
5. Railway auto-detects `nixpacks.toml` + `Procfile` and deploys.
6. Check **Deployments → Logs** to confirm: `✅ Database connection OK.` then `✅ @YourBot is LIVE!`

### MongoDB Atlas — IP Whitelist
Railway uses dynamic IPs. In Atlas → Network Access → add:
```
0.0.0.0/0
```
(Allow access from anywhere — required since Railway IPs change. A wrong/missing
whitelist entry is the #1 reason a bot deploys "successfully" but never responds —
the bot now detects this on startup and logs exactly why instead of crash-looping silently.)

---

## 🐙 Deploy on GitHub (Push Instructions)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "🏏 Initial commit - CricCraze Bot"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/CricCrazeBot.git
git push -u origin main
```

> ⚠️ `.env` is git-ignored — never commit real tokens! Use `.env.example` as reference only.

## 🎮 Quick Command Reference

| Mode | Start Command |
|---|---|
| Solo Match | `/start` → tap **Solo Match** |
| Team Match | `/start` → tap **Team Match** → `/create_teams` |
| Tournament | `/tournament` |
| Full Help | `/help` |

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Bowler **must** `/start` the bot in **DM** at least once, or they won't receive bowling prompts.
- Each group can run **only one active match** at a time (Solo / Team / Tournament).
- Bowler/batter number input no longer relies on a fragile third-party "listen"
  patch — it's handled by the bot's normal message handlers, the same reliable
  pattern used throughout this project, so it keeps working across restarts.

🏏 **Built with Pyrogram (kurigram) + MongoDB.** Ready to deploy. Pure cricket, no drama.
